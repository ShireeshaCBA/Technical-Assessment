# Technical-Assessment

# Scope of Work : 
The technical assessment includes building the forecast of weather and the testing. However, due to the available time, I’ve taken one component of it i.e. to display weather of a particular location, when the location is selected using VB Script. However, this can be extended to include other components as requested as well, given some more time.

# Technical Overview :
Programming Language : VB Script
Input Source : Weather details of various locations captured from google at a point in time("Weather.xlsx"). 

# Instructions to run the script :

* Script_comments text file contains the code with comments.
* Weather.xlsx contains weather details of the locations.
* Please double click on the "Script" file to run the program.
* Enter the locations which are in the excel file named "Weather.xlsx".
* As I took only 5 locations, please enter the locations that are in the excel file.
* Locations that are in available in the data base ( that is "Weather.xlsx" ) are 
	a. Sydney
	b. Melbourne
	c. Adelaide
	d. Goa
	e. Srilanka
* If location other than the above mentioned is given as input, code prompts to enter a valid location.
